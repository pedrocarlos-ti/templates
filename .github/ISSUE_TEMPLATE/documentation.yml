        This template is strictly used for documentation issues, including:

        - Documenting undocumented Components/APIs;
        - Updating external links;
        - Anything else that doesn't require touching the codebase itself.

        If you followed the documentation but things don't work, take some time to consider if it's the documentation or the code that's wrong. In the latter, prefer using the "bug" template.
